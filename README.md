# Description

The goal of this task is to get a basic handle on lifetimes in rust. I am pretty sure that this simple example will not cover enough cases/examples, but it is at least an intial starting point to learn from.

# Tasks
- [ ] initial state
  - [ ] create a basic app with integers, strings, and structs without lifetimes.
- [ ] lifetime implementation
  - [X] replace the int function with a lifetime based equivalent
  - [X] replace the string function with a lifetime based equivalent
  - [ ] replace the struct function with a lifetime based equivalent
