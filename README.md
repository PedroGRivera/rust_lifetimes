# Description

The goal of this task is to get a basic handle on lifetimes in rust. I am pretty sure that this simple example will not cover enough cases/examples, but it is at least an intial starting point to learn from.

# Tasks
- [ ] initial state
  - [ ] create a basic app with integers, strings, and structs without lifetimes.
  - [ ] create a function to take a clone/copy of the data, do some basic work, and return a resultant value
- [ ] lifetime implementation
  - [ ] replace the int function with a lifetime based equivalent
  - [ ] replace the string function with a lifetime based equivalent
  - [ ] replace the struct function with a lifetime based equivalent
